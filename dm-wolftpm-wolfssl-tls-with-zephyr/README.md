## NOTICE

To use this demo you need the following branches until wolfSSL and wolfTPM are
updated to support Zephyr for the DEMO:
1. wolfTPM in the `west.yml` needs to be updated to use the following branch:
This only needs to happen if this
[wolfTPM PR](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfTPM/pull/395) is not merged:
```
    remotes:
        - name: wolftpm
          url-base: https://github.com/aidangarske
    projects:
        - name: wolftpm
          path: modules/lib/wolftpm
          revision: tpm_zephyr_support
          remote: wolftpm
```

2. wolfSSL need to point to master, so update the `west.yml`
```
    projects:
        - name: wolftpm
          path: modules/lib/wolftpm
          revision: master
          remote: wolftpm

2. Under the "Projects" tab, right click the project and choose "build selected", this should result in no errors. 

[<img src="Images/Setup3-3.png" width="300"/>](Images/Setup3-3.png)

The project should be called `dm-wolftpm-wolfssl-tls-with-zephyr`.

### 3.2 SD Card Setup

**Note**: The key files and certificates generated by the demo will be stored on this SD card. If you want to keep these files for future use, make sure to back them up before reformatting or using the card for other purposes.

#### 3.2.1 Using the Setup Script (Recommended)

We provide a convenient script to set up your SD card properly.

**Requirements**
- An SD card (any size is sufficient)
- SD card must be formatted as FAT32 (the script can format it for you if needed)
- The card must be mountable on your Linux system

**Using the Setup Script**

1. Insert your SD card into your computer
2. Run the setup script:
   ```
   ./setup_sdcard.sh
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Show all available disks and partitions on your system
   - Prompt you to enter the correct partition device (e.g., `/dev/sdb1`)
   - Optionally format the card as FAT32 if needed
   - Copy the necessary certificate files to the SD card

**Help and Troubleshooting**

For detailed help:

### 3.3 Connect Hardware
1. Plug in your TPM to the corresponding ports
    ```
    ports:
        #TODO ADD CIRCUIT SCHEMATIC
    ```

2. Insert the formatted FAT32 SD card into the appropriate slot
3. Connect the FRDM-MCXN947 to your computer with the provided USB-C Cable
4. Connect an Ethernet cable to your network (required for TLS server functionality)

### 3.4 Program and Run the Demo
1. Flash the .elf to FRDM-MCXN947, Can be done with right clicking the project and choosing to `flash the selected target`
2. Connect to the Serial Output of the FRDM-MCXN947 via:
    - Screen Command - `screen /dev/tty"MCXN-Port" 115200`
    - Some Serial Terminal you are familiar with 
3. Push reset button on the FRDM-MCXN947 board and view the startup message with available commands.

### 4.2 Manual Demonstration Workflow
While the `-demo` command provides a quick way to run through all the TPM features, you can also perform these operations manually step by step for more control over the process. This section outlines how to replicate the demo functionality using individual commands.

#### Step 1: Generate Keys with `-keygen`
First, generate the cryptographic keys that will be used for TLS communications:

1. Run the `-keygen` command
2. When prompted, select RSA key type (option 1)
3. Specify output file (e.g., "/SD:/rsa.raw")
4. Choose "y" for default template
5. Select "1" for AES parameter encryption
6. For additional options, enter "-pem" to output in PEM format

This will generate an RSA key protected by the TPM with AES parameter encryption and saved in PEM format.

#### Step 2: Create a Certificate with `-cert`
Next, create a certificate signing request (CSR) using the key you just generated:

1. Run the `-cert` command
2. The command will automatically use the TPM-protected key to generate a CSR
3. The CSR will be saved to the SD card
4. Copy the generated RSA Cert and place it into a file on your local computer

This step creates a certificate that can be used by the TLS server for authentication.

#### Step 3: Start the TLS Server with `-server`
Finally, start the TLS server using the key and certificate:

1. Run the `-server` command
2. Select RSA key type (option 1)
3. Choose "1" for AES parameter encryption
4. Select "y" for PK callbacks
5. Choose "y" to generate a self-signed certificate
6. Leave port option empty to use the default port (11111)

The server will start and listen for incoming connections. You can connect to it using a TLS client as described in section 4.3.

By following these three steps manually, you have complete control over each part of the process that the `-demo` command automates.

### 4.3 Communication with the server

1. `cd __repo__/modules/crypto/wolfssl`
2. `./autogen.sh`
3. `./configure`
4. `make`
5. cp the noted cert generated by the device to the `wolfssl` directory and make sure its saved as `<name>.pem`. Name is your choice.
6. Make sure the server is running on zephyr via the `-server` or `-demo` command
7. Connect with the client
    ```
    ./example/client/client -h <ip of zephyr device as displaced at boot> -A <path/to/cert.pem/you/saved> -w
    ```


## 5. Project Options<a name="step5"></a>
### 5.1 Setting up a static IPv4 on Zephyr
By default the project is set up to use a DHCP Server, this section will show how to set up a static IP. Please make sure you choose an IP for the device that will not cause an IP conflict on your network.

1. In [src/main.c](src/main.c), look for the following section.

    [<img src="Images/ProjectOptions5-1-1.png" width="600"/>](Images/ProjectOptions5-1-1.png)

2. Set DHCP off for the project by changing

    `#define DHCP_ON 1` 
    
    to

    `#define DHCP_ON 0`

3. Set the `STATIC_IPV4_ADDR` macro to your desired IP, by default it is set to `192.168.1.70`. Make sure the IP you choose does not cause a conflict on your network.

4. Set the `STATIC_IPV4_GATEWAY` macro to your network's gateway. Usually this is `192.168.1.1` on home networks, however this could not always be the case. This is usually the IP of your primary network router.

5. Set the `STATIC_IPV4_NETMASK` macro to your needs. Generally `255.255.255.0` for most use cases.

6. Rebuild the project and flash the device.
